# face-detector
Using ML Kit's face detection API, this app will detect faces in an image, identify key facial features, and get the contours of detected faces.

(Face detection)[https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/face-detection] locates human faces in visual media such as digital images or video. When a face is detected it has an associated position, size,
 and orientation; and it can be searched for landmarks such as the eyes and nose.

ML Kit makes it easy to apply ML techniques in your apps by bringing Google's ML technologies, such as the (Mobile Vision)[https://developers.google.com/vision/], and (TensorFlow Lite)[https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/tflite/],
together in a single SDK. Whether you need the real-time capabilities of Mobile Vision's on-device models, or the flexibility of custom TensorFlow Lite models, ML Kit has you covered.
