# face-detector
Using ML Kit's face detection API, this app will detect faces in an image, identify key facial features, and get the contours of detected faces.

(Face detection)[https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/face-detection/android] locates human faces in visual media such as digital images or video. When a face is detected it has an associated position, size,
 and orientation; and it can be searched for landmarks such as the eyes and nose.
